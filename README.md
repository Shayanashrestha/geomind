# Project Geomind - LLM geolocation detection of images

Welcome to Project Geomind! We are a team of 3 graduate students at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville
who are examining what percentage of blur applied to an image nullifies an AI/LLM's ability to figure out
the location that the image was taken.

## Work so Far
- We have compiled a dataset of 37 images from Microsoft's COCO dataset and Google Maps streetview images
- We tested Gemini Pro 2.5 and Claude Sonnet 2.5's accuracy on these original images
- We have created all 6 variations that we had planned test.
- We have finished about 10/12 of our tests

### Variations to Test
- In Gemini Nanobanana: "Blur the image so the location is unidentifiable"
- Blur entire image 10%
- Blur entire image 20%
- Blur entire image 30%
- Blur any text in the image
- Blur personally/publicly identifiable objects in the image
