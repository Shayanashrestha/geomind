# Project Geomind - LLM geolocation detection of images

Welcome to Project Geomind! We are a team of 3 graduate students at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville
who are examining what percentage of blur applied to an image nullifies an AI/LLM's ability to figure out
the location that the image was taken.

## Work so Far
- We have compiled a dataset of 37 images from Microsoft's COCO dataset and Google Maps streetview images
- We tested Gemini Pro 2.5 and Claude Sonnet 2.5's accuracy on these images
- We are created 6 variations of each image (4 done so far)
